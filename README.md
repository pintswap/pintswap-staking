Sources for OPPS, sipERC20, and the PINT network token.

OPPS NFTs are provisioned to entities who run optimization strategies on the exchange and perform order matching. Routing is possible via assets held in sipERC20 vaults. The underlying assets in a sipERC20 contract are available for any optimization strategy by PintP2P programs connected with a wallet holding OPPS. Proceeds from optimization flow back to PINT stakers as well as those who participate in the single-sided staking provided by sipERC20.

The protocol is designed to enable single-sided staking that is viable for assets which may have a low market capitalization. Yield should always be in terms of the underlying asset, no matter what it is.
